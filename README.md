## Description

During the development we used git submodules to use the Repertoire model.
To make things easier, at the end we included the TP2 as a package of the `TP3 - Servlet`.

This TP use the same kind of interface as the TP2.
There is 3 Servlets:
- One for the authentication
- One to manage the different repertoires
- One to manage a repertoire

The only user authorized for now is hard coded. The identifier is `test` and the password is `test`.
